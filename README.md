# grunt-basic-serve

## Getting Started
This is an example usage structure for GruntFile.js as a defaul http server via local files

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.


## Install dev dependencies
### `npm install`

This will create a new folder, ./node_modules, and store our dependencies there. Now launch server with:


### `grunt`

You should see output that looks like this:

Running "connect:example" (connect) task
Opening server for ./ on port 2323.

Now you can open the browser of your choice and navigate to http://localhost:2323

It basically serves your files in base directory with localhost
